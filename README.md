# Plentific Coding Challenge Library
Package to pull, transform and create data from https://reqres.in/ sample API.

This repository includes the package, the use of which will be demonstrated in https://github.com/sarahLHeanan/plentific-coding-challenge. As requested, I have not pushed this project to packagist, but I have included in the former repo as a VCS dependency to demonstrate usage.

## Unit tests
Full non aliased path to execute: `vendor/bin/phpunit tests/UserTest.php`

I have left a couple of commented out lines with regard to testing exception handling. Despite a lot of searching I couldn't figure out why these wouldn't execute as intended (maybe to do with the fact that I am catching the Exceptions).
